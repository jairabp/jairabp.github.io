## My Prior Experience
Before this class, I had very little experience with JavaScript. In high school, we learned how to create websites, but as expected, we used HTML and CSS more than JavaScript when doing assignments, so I hardly remembered anything we learned back then. I got so used to learning new languages every semester that it hardly registered to me how different JavaScript is from the main three I learned: Java, C++, and Python. My favorite difference is how I don't need to declare what type of data every variable is. As of now, JavaScript is similar to Python in the simplicity of its syntax. To be honest, I’m already forgetting a lot of the syntax when it comes to the more complex stuff like arrays, but in general, it is very similar to every other programming language when it comes to concepts like loops and boolean statements.

## Is Javascript really suitable for Software Engineering? Maybe for psuedocode...
As for software engineering, JavaScript is an appropriate language because if you were to make a pseudocode for a problem, the pseudocode would be very similar to how you would have to end up typing the code. I love how simplistic the syntax is compared to other languages. However, I wouldn’t say that software engineering is the best for software engineering because I personally see JavaScript with visuals just because it’s the main three for writing websites alongside HTML and CSS.

## Are WODs useful?
The practice WODs were definitely helpful because they made me feel better about understanding what to do instead of going blank for the first WOD. I thought I would never expect to pass the WODs because I thought it would be similar to the daily quizzes I had for ICS 211, where I basically failed almost every single one. But having a practice one with a common prompt while it’s everyone’s first time learning JavaScript made it feel less advantageous and more balanced that it’s everyone’s first time. This learning style is definitely gonna be one of the most useful ones I’ll ever experience. The WODs are gonna make me remember to code more frequently and not only when I’m coding. This will jog my memory in the most efficient way possible without overstressing myself.
