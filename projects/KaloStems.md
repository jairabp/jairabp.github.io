## Overview

Our platform, Kalo Stems, will allow UH students to connect with career opportunities that are tailored to their interests and skills. Students will be able to specify their background and aspirations, allowing companies to view students who are the best fit for their opportunity.

This application will illustrate various technologies useful to ICS software engineering student, including:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
