When I was in 7th grade, I created a National History Day project based on the theme "Taking a Stand in History." My two partners and I decided to focus on the Children's March, which was a stand for civil rights in Birmingham, Alabama. Our project proceeded to the Districts Division for Oahu, then the States Division for Hawaii, and to the Nationals Division in Washington D.C.
