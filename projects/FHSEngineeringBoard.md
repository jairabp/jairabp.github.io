August 2018 - May 2022
Student board that focused on bringing a voice to the Engineering Academyâ€™s students and responsible for Academy events and duties. Took the Treasurer role in my second and third year. Became President in my fourth year. Created sheets to analyze and ensure profitable fundraising events. Took charge and oversaw multiple academy events such as Orientation, Induction, and Graduation. Was one of the few ambassadors that represented the academy at outside events.

In my freshman year, I joined this club when it used to be the Engineering Board. I joined as a member the first year it was officially founded and recognized by Farrington High School. Loving the community around the club, I decided to apply for a leadership role and became their Treasurer in my sophomore year and junior year. As a loyal and commited student to the Engineering Board, I decided to become their President for my senior year. This was when the we combined our club with the Engineering Ambassadors, who helped give tour guides and promote our academy to nearby schools in the Kalihi district.
